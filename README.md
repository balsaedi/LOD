# LOD
Limit of detection for ISE
# mapping signals to concentraion doman.R
This function will use root finding methods (aka Bisection method) to map the multivariate signals to a single concentration value. 
For now, i'll focus on the case where we have two signals (2 ISEs) that correspond to one sample.
